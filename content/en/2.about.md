# Working Groups

Our working groups support the network’s aim to strengthen digital humanities in Norway. 
They provide spaces for collaboration within defined areas and extend the network’s activities beyond the yearly conference and lecture series.

The current working groups are:

- [The Board](#the-board)  
- [The Webinar Group](#the-webinar-group)  
- [The Annual Conference Group](#the-annual-conference-group)  
- [DH and Libraries in Higher Education](#dh-and-libraries-in-higher-education)  
- [DH på norsk](#dh-på-norsk)   

Members who wish to join a working group are invited to submit an expression of interest.  
All DHKO members may take part. Membership in the network is obtained by registering on the [mailing list](https://gaggle.email/join/dhko.list@dhko.no).

## The Board

The board working groups consist of a selection of academics affiliated with various institutions in Norway, and the work is unpaid. The working group is elected annually at the beginning of January. We strive to have at least one person from each major Norwegian institution where it is relevant. The working group commits to using the institution's available funds to promote the network's activities.

## **Webinar Group 2025**

The Webinar Group coordinates the [DH lecture series](https://dhko.no/en/webinar) in collaboration with the Digital Lab at the University Library in Bergen and D-Lab at NTNU. The series highlights current work in digital humanities and offers researchers and practitioners a forum to present projects, methods, and challenges.
