# **Working group**  


The working group consists of a selection of academics affiliated with various institutions in Norway, and the work is unpaid. The working group is elected annually at the beginning of January. We strive to have at least one person from each major Norwegian institution where it is relevant. The working group commits to using the institution's available funds to promote the network's activities.
