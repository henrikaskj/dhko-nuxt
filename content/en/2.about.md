# **Working group**  


The board working groups consist of a selection of academics affiliated with various institutions in Norway, and the work is unpaid. The working group is elected annually at the beginning of January. We strive to have at least one person from each major Norwegian institution where it is relevant. The working group commits to using the institution's available funds to promote the network's activities. 

In addition to the board, we have two working groups: one dedicated to the 2025 webinar series and the other to the annual conference.
