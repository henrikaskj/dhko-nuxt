# Working Groups

Working groups support the network’s aim to strengthen digital humanities in Norway, with particular attention to the LAM sector. They provide a space for collaboration within a defined area and extend the network’s activities beyond the yearly conference and lecture series.

The Board has approved the following informal working groups:

## DH and Libraries in Higher Education
This group addresses digital humanities within university libraries. It focuses on research support, infrastructure, teaching, and the role of libraries as partners in digital scholarship.

## DH på norsk
This group explores the use, development, and discussion of digital humanities in Norwegian. It supports work that concerns Norwegian language, terminology, and practice across the research and LAM sectors.

Members who wish to join a working group are invited to submit an expression of interest through the available forms. All DHKO members are welcome to take part. Membership of the network comes through registration on the mailing list, which carries no further obligations.
