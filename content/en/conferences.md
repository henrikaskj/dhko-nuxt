# Conference theme for 2024: digital and digitized traces
## Call for papers and workshops
With this year's theme, we wish to include all humanities-oriented research on and with materials in digital form. This includes both the digital-born and digital twins. The latter refers to what we get when we digitize materials that originally exists in different physical forms. What these traces have in common is that they come with conditions that have an effect on how something can be researched and what it is possible to get out of them. Weâ€™re looking for what leaves traces, how these traces come to be, and what these traces can be used for. The theme is therefore broad enough to cover the definition of humanities by media historian professor John Durham Peters, as the disciplines for the storage, transmission and interpretation of culture.
 
We invite submissions for either presentations (day 2) or workshops (day 1). Below is a non-exhaustive list of suggested topics of particular relevance.
<br><br>
**Topics of particular relevance:**

Overall, the focus is on digital-born data from the internet or digitized material and culture as data. Below, we propose some examples of relevant topics:
 
- Visualization of data/GIS technology on digital-born material and digital twins
- Text analysis or analyses using CBIR (content-based image retrieval) on digital and digitized archives
- Text or multimodal analyses on (meta)data from social media
- Studies of cultural phenomena through digital traces and materials
- Use of cultural metadata in humanistic research
- Data feminism studies (e.g., close readings of datasets)
- Digital editions philology
- Preservation, maintenance and curation of digital culture or digitalized culture/cultural heritage
- Digital curation, particularly algorithms, in both social media and other digital platforms for cultural dissemination and cultural organization
- CMC (computer mediated communication) in the face of AI-generated text
- Challenges with slop (AI-generated text, images, etc.) in research with the internet as a field
- Infrastructure studies and/or technographic perspectives on cultural organization
 
And/or

- Methodological considerations related to one or more of these topics
 <br><br>
 
For workshop submission we are particularly interested in workshops that deal with various software and other research-oriented user interfaces that can be used by researchers and other professionals to work with digital or digitized material.
 
Submitted abstracts for presentations should be max. 300 words. Presentations will be 10 minutes + 5 minutes questions/discussion. Submissions for workshops should also be max. 300 words. Please include whether you would like your workshop to be 45 minutes or 2x45 minutes.
 <br><br>
**Important dates**

The deadline for submissions is **August 15**. Responses to submitted abstracts will be sent out **August 25**. We will strive to include all submitted contributions, but if we receive more than there is room for, the following criteria will apply:
- Explicit thematic relevance
- Contribution to the overall breadth of the conference program
- Cooperation between higher ed institutions and the LAM sector
 
The language for presentations or workshops can be either Norwegian or English. Please specify which language(s) you will present or hold your workshop in. Please note that the final program will require abstracts in both languages.
