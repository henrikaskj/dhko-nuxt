# Conference theme for 2024: digital and digitized traces
## Welcome to DHKO 2024
With this year's theme, we wish to include all humanities-oriented research on and with materials in digital form. This includes both the digital-born and digital twins. The latter refers to what we get when we digitize materials that originally exists in different physical forms. What these traces have in common is that they come with conditions that have an effect on how something can be researched and what it is possible to get out of them. We’re looking for what leaves traces, how these traces come to be, and what these traces can be used for. The theme is therefore broad enough to cover the definition of humanities by media historian professor John Durham Peters, as the disciplines for the storage, transmission and interpretation of culture.
 
This year’s conference is happening at NTNU, with workshops (only in Norwegian) at NTNU Dragvoll on Monday 21st of October, and conference presentations at NTNU Kalvskinnet on Tuesday, October 22nd.

**ARTISTIC KEYNOTE: Code Poetry: The constraints of programming and making art with code**

*Chris Kerr (UK) will explore how code poetry can be seen as a form of highly-constrained writing. He will look back at the history of French collective Oulipo and their engagement with computer science, focusing on work by Oulipo members Noël Arnaud and Valérie Beaudouin. Chris will also explore how programmers play with constraints today, from "code golf" to esoteric programming languages. Meanwhile, he will present the constraints of his collection ./code --poetry, co-authored with Daniel Holden*

*Chris Kerr is a poet who lives in London. He co-wrote ./code --poetry with Daniel Holden. This work, published by Broken Sleep Books in 2023, is a collection of code poems each written in the source code of a different programming language. Every poem is also a valid program which produces a visual representation of itself when compiled and run (see [code-poetry.com](https://code-poetry.com/).). Some code poems from ./code --poetry are being exhibited in the Maschinenpoesie (Machine Poetry) exhibition at Museum Strauhof in Zurich, Switzerland until January 2025.*

**CONFERENCE KEYNOTE:**
**A Thousand Years of Graffiti - War, Cultural Heritage in Peril, and Digital Humanities**
**Jonathan Westin, GRIDH**
 
*Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv is a world heritage a thousand years old and a source of knowledge that is now threatened by the ongoing war. Carved into its frail frescoes are more than seven thousand inscriptions in multiple languages from those that have visited the cathedral over the centuries. Observations and marks from travellers, merchants, and princesses mix with crude drawings and messages of yearnings and pleads for salvation. Jonathan Westin, Director of GRIDH, Gothenburg Research Infrastructure in Digital Humanities, presents how he together with his colleagues strive to help Ukraine to preserve and analyse these threatened  historical sources digitally before they are destroyed, and what roll Digital Humanities can play in contingency planning and securing cultural heritage for the future.* 
* 

*Jonathan Westin is an associate professor in Conservation and current Director of Gothenburg Research Infrastructure in Digital Humanities ([GRIDH](https://www.gu.se/digital-humaniora)) at the University of Gothenburg. His research focuses on how we form our perception of culture through representations, and how these representations become part of our cultural heritage. By focusing on the communicative aspects of culture management, he approaches the creation of visual representations as a negotiation process between new research and established images.*


Tuesday is the day of conference presentations. We have tried to sort thematically the presentations for this year. The following themes are featured in the conference: **mapping and classification (Norwegian), digital culture (English), digital cultural heritage (English), methodological paths forward (Norwegian)**. A shortened version of the abstracts submitted is found in the program linked below.
