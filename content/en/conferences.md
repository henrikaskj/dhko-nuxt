# Conference 2024
SAVE THE DATE! This year's conference will be held in Trondheim, at (and in collaboration with) NTNU, October 21 -22nd 2024. The conference will have the theme “digital and digitized traces”. With this theme, we wish to include all humanities-oriented research on and with materials in digital form. This includes both the digital-born and digital twins. The latter refers to what we get when we digitize materials that originally exists in different physical forms. What these traces have in common is that they come with conditions that have an effect on how something can be researched and what it is possible to get out of them. 

This year’s conference will include a day of workshops and a day of paper presentations. 
The day will also have a session for master students to present their projects. 

More information on this year’s conference will be sent out in May/June, with a complete Call for Papers (and workshops). The information will also be available here.
