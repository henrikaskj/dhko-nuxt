# Conference theme for 2024: digital and digitized traces
## Registration open for 21-22 October
With this year's theme, we wish to include all humanities-oriented research on and with materials in digital form. This includes both the digital-born and digital twins. The latter refers to what we get when we digitize materials that originally exists in different physical forms. What these traces have in common is that they come with conditions that have an effect on how something can be researched and what it is possible to get out of them. We’re looking for what leaves traces, how these traces come to be, and what these traces can be used for. The theme is therefore broad enough to cover the definition of humanities by media historian professor John Durham Peters, as the disciplines for the storage, transmission and interpretation of culture.
 
This year’s conference is happening at NTNU, with workshops (only in Norwegian) at NTNU Dragvoll on Monday 21st of October, and conference presentations at NTNU Kalveskinnet on Tuesday, October 22nd.

The conference dinner will happen on Monday 17:30. More information will be provided. The dinner is not covered by the conference and is a pay-yourself-event. However, we will book a non-expensive place that is suitable for everyone. 

Tuesday is the day of conference presentations. We have tried to sort thematically the presentations for this year. The following themes are featured in the conference: **mapping and classification (Norwegian), digital culture (English), digital cultural heritage (English), methodological paths forward (Norwegian)**. A shortened version of the abstracts submitted is found in the program linked below.

A detailed program (with full abstracts), including rooms and building location, chairs, and other specifications will be published and sent out to all registered prior to the conference.
