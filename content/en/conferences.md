# Conference 2025

The third annual conference of the National Research Network for Digital Humanities and Culture Organisation (DHKO) will be held at University of Inland Norway at Campus Hamar in collaboration with the research group *Digital Communication and Culture* and the research project *Verden på norsk*, on **Wednesday 15th and Thursday 16th October 2025**.


**Deadline for submission of abstract: 15th August 2025.**

This year's conference has the theme “Infrastructure and Interface”. With this, we wish to encompass all humanistically oriented research on, with and about infrastructures and interfaces. From visual epistemology, via digital media and materials, to research infrastructures and organisation of culture. And not least archives, museums and libraries as infrastructures and interfaces for digital humanities research for past, present, and future.

This year's conference will include workshops and presentations, as well as two keynotes (TBA).
Presenters and workshop participants at the conference will also have the opportunity to contribute articles to a special issue of a peer-reviewed Norwegian Register Level 1 journal, [DHNB Publications](https://journals.uio.no/dhnbpub), following the conference.
