# DH Lecture Series 

The DH lecture series is a collaboration between the [Digital Lab](https://www.uib.no/en/digitallab) at the [University Library](https://www.uib.no/en/ub) in Bergen, [D-Lab](https://www.ntnu.no/ub/d-lab) at NTNU and the Norwegian Network for Digital Humanities and Cultural Orgainzation (DHKO). The lecture series addresses DH-related topics and gives researchers and others involved in DH projects or research the opportunity to share their experiences, successes and challenges related to the use of digital tools and/or methods.

Information about the lectures will be announced well in advance via the DHKO mailing list, and posted on [the event calendar of the Digital Lab at UiB,](https://www.uib.no/en/digitallab/calendar) where you can register to receive a Zoom link.

Do you have suggestions for topics you would like to hear more about, or are you working on something that you would like to share in a lecture? Do not hesitate to contact [the organizers by e-mail](emma.aadland@uib.no).

### January 2026

**29.01.2026 - Exploring the Research Potential of Norway’s Web Archive**

The National Library of Norway has preserved a vast digital footprint of the internet. Now, with the WEBDATA project, researchers will gain unprecedented access to explore and analyze this unique resource.

*The talk will be held in Norwegian.*

**The WEBDATA project**

Since the 1990s, the National Library of Norway (NB) has collected and preserved large amounts of content from the internet. This web archive is in demand among researchers and holds great potential for academic knowledge production. Through the WEBDATA project, a national research infrastructure is being developed that enables searching, exploring, and analyzing data from this archive.

[Jon Tønnessen](https://www.nb.no/ansatte/jon-carlstedt-tonnessen/) is an internet historian and researcher at NB. After presenting the main goals of the project, he will demonstrate a preliminary test platform for search and exploration. Tønnessen will also share insights from the work of mapping researchers’ needs. Participants are invited to contribute to this effort by answering a short survey, ensuring that the infrastructure provides maximum value for research communities.

The WEBDATA project partners are the National Library of Norway, the Norwegian Computing Center, the University of Oslo (LTG and Humit), and UiT The Arctic University of Norway. The project is funded by the Research Council of Norway.

### February 2026

**26.02.2026 - Building Termportalen**

In this Digital Humanities lunch talk (DH-lunch) Jan Ole Bangen gives a developer's perspective on interdisciplinary collaboration in building the national language infrastructure Termportalen.

*The talk will be held in English.*

Termportalen is Norway's national terminology infrastructure, providing a search portal at [termportalen.no](https://www.termportalen.no/), tools, and a competence milieu for terminology management. Government-funded and part of the University of Bergen Library's Language Collections since 2021, it serves as the hub for Norwegian terminology work in collaboration with the Language Council of Norway.

Termportalen's work requires close collaboration between terminologists and developers. This talk examines this interdisciplinary collaboration through three ongoing discussions from a developer's point of view: project-based vs. product-focused organization and its implications for terminology infrastructure; the use of evidence-based prioritization to address domain loss in Norwegian specialized language; and the collaborative development of digital workflows for terminology work and quality control. Throughout, the importance of explicitly coordinating responsibilities and competencies emerges as a recurring theme.

[Jan Ole Bangen](https://www4.uib.no/en/find-employees/Jan.Ole.Bangen) works as a developer at the University of Bergen Library.
