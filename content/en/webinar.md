## DH lectures Autumn 2025: 

- **Thursday 25 September at 11:30-12:00 [IN NORWEGIAN]**

**What can literary travelogues tell us about 19th-century Norway?**

Join us for the first Digital Humanities Lunch Lecture (DH-lunch) of the autumn, where we’ll explore what the Norwegian Travel Literature Corpus can reveal about how Norway was portrayed in 19th-century travel writing, both by foreign travelers and Norwegians themselves.

PhD candidate [Marit Sjelmo](https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/marit.sjelmo) will present her project and share how she has worked with the Norwegian Travel Literature Corpus from a macro perspective using digital tools.

**About the lecturer and the PhD project**

Marit Sjelmo is a PhD candidate at NTNU, Department of Language and Literature. In her doctoral project titled "Den litterære landmålingen av Norge: reiseskildringer 1800–1850", she investigates representations of Norway in 19th-century travel literature.

Over the course of a century, from 1800 to 1900, Norway transitions from being portrayed as a «terra incognita» in this literature to appearing as a modern European nation-state and a destination for global mass tourism.

As literary data, she uses an international corpus consisting of approximately 750 travelogues from the National Library’s archives, which she has named the Norwegian Travel Literature Corpus 1800–1900.

The project is affiliated with the research group Literature, Technology and Media at the Department of Language and Literature at NTNU, and the Research Council of Norway project [ImagiNation. Mapping the Imagined Geographies of Norwegian Literature from 1814 to 1905](https://www.ntnu.edu/isl/imagination).
