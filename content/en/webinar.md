# **Webinar Series 2025**

The DH lecture series is a collaboration between the [Digital Lab](https://www.uib.no/en/digitallab) at the [University Library](https://www.uib.no/en/ub) in Bergen, [D-Lab](https://www.ntnu.no/ub/d-lab) at NTNU and the Norwegian Network for Digital Humanities and Cultural Orgainzation (DHKO). The lecture series addresses DH-related topics and gives researchers and others involved in DH projects or research the opportunity to share their experiences, successes and challenges related to the use of digital tools and/or methods.

Information about the lectures will be announced well in advance via the DHKO mailing list, and posted on [the event calendar of the Digital Lab at UiB,](https://www.uib.no/en/digitallab/calendar) where you can register to receive a Zoom link.

Do you have suggestions for topics you would like to hear more about, or are you working on something that you would like to share in a lecture? Do not hesitate to contact [the organizers by e-mail](emma.aadland@uib.no).

## DH lectures Autumn 2025: 

- **Thursday 27 November at 11:30-12:00 IN NORWEGIAN**

[Åslaug Ommundsen](https://www4.uib.no/en/find-employees/%C3%85slaug.Ommundsen) is a professor of Medieval Latin philology at the University of Bergen and one of four research leaders on the ERC-funded project [CODICUM](https://www.codicum.eu/home). The project investigates Nordic collections of medieval book fragments to shed light on book culture and scholarly networks during the period ca. 1000–1500.

One element of the CODICUM project is to explore how book fragments can best be presented as virtual books. Fragments from the same book are often scattered across multiple collections, and even across national borders. The digital format offers a unique opportunity to reunite these fragments into a conceptual structure, thereby conveying a (fragmentary) impression of the book that once existed.

But how can this be done in the best possible way? What has been achieved so far, and what lies ahead? These are questions addressed in the lecture.

### DH-Lunch: Norchron - Norwegian diachronic corpus

A research project that aims to build a digital text collection covering the development of the Norwegian language from the runic inscriptions until 1814.

**About Norchron**

Norwegian Diachronic Corpus (Norchron) is a research project that aims to build up a digital text collection that covers the development of the Norwegian language from the runic inscriptions up to 1814. The project is led by Humit – Centre for Digital Development at the University of Oslo – and has received support from the Research Council of Norway.

A corpus is a digital collection of texts that captures instances of linguistic expression. Corporas provide a picture of natural language use, and can be used as a basis for research.  In Norchron, the texts will be analyzed grammatically, localized, and made available to both researchers and the general public. Many of the texts are already available in digital formats, but are scattered in different places and in different formats. Other texts require more detailed philological processing before they can be published.

Norchron fills an important gap in existing corpus resources by offering a historical dimension that has previously been lacking. The project will create a historical corpus of the Norwegian language from the runic inscriptions up to 1814.

**Presented by Dag Trygve Truslew Haug**

Norchron is presented by Dag Trygve Truslew Haug. He is a professor of linguistics and classical languages at the University of Oslo, with a background in Greek, Latin and historical linguistics. He has published widely in formal semantics, syntax and digital humanities, and is now head of the Centre for Digital Development at the Faculty of Humanities. Haug has received several research awards, including the Nils Klim Prize, and has been central in the development of corpus resources for ancient Indo-European languages.
