## DH lectures Autumn 2025: 

- **Thursday 25 September at 11:30-12:00 [IN NORWEGIAN]**

**What can literary travelogues tell us about 19th-century Norway?**

Join us for the first Digital Humanities Lunch Lecture (DH-lunch) of the autumn, where we’ll explore what the Norwegian Travel Literature Corpus can reveal about how Norway was portrayed in 19th-century travel writing, both by foreign travelers and Norwegians themselves.

PhD candidate [Marit Sjelmo](https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/marit.sjelmo) will present her project and share how she has worked with the Norwegian Travel Literature Corpus from a macro perspective using digital tools.

**About the lecturer and the PhD project**

Marit Sjelmo is a PhD candidate at NTNU, Department of Language and Literature. In her doctoral project titled "Den litterære landmålingen av Norge: reiseskildringer 1800–1850", she investigates representations of Norway in 19th-century travel literature.

Over the course of a century, from 1800 to 1900, Norway transitions from being portrayed as a «terra incognita» in this literature to appearing as a modern European nation-state and a destination for global mass tourism.

As literary data, she uses an international corpus consisting of approximately 750 travelogues from the National Library’s archives, which she has named the Norwegian Travel Literature Corpus 1800–1900.

The project is affiliated with the research group Literature, Technology and Media at the Department of Language and Literature at NTNU, and the Research Council of Norway project [ImagiNation. Mapping the Imagined Geographies of Norwegian Literature from 1814 to 1905](https://www.ntnu.edu/isl/imagination).

In his lecture, he explores the phenomenon of "algorithmic folklore", which is a new interaction between human creativity and automation. Through four thought-provoking theses, he wants to shed light on how algorithms not only shape what we see, but also how we create.

- **Thursday, March 13, 11:30-12:00 [IN NORWEGIAN]**

The speaker is [Siv Gøril Brandtzæg](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/siv.brandtzag), Associate Professor of Literary Studies at the [Department of Language and Literature](https://www.ntnu.edu/isl) at NTNU.

In the years 2018-2022, several projects were launched in Norway that aimed to shed light on the place of broadside poems in Norwegian cultural heritage. In one of these projects, the NTNU [Gunnerus Library's](https://www.ntnu.edu/ub/libraries/gunnerus) collection of broadside prints was digitized. The work to make the collection available was led by Siv Gøril Brandtzæg, who also created the first and currently only database of broadside poems in Norway.

In this lecture, Siv Gøril Brandtzæg will talk about the work of developing the database, which is built on the open web application Omeka. The construction and design of the database was a collaboration between Brandtzæg and the IT department at NTNU. The collaboration also included a web designer from a private company. Brandtzæg will talk about the collaboration with the various actors, and what challenges she, as a humanist without IT skills, faced on the way to the database.

The session will introduce the key features of [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/), demonstrating how it can address common data challenges such as inconsistent formatting, duplicate entries, and incomplete records. This lecture is intended for a broad audience, and showcases practical scenarios where OpenRefine can significantly reduce manual data preparation efforts.

Predicting the Buried Past: Using Digital Tools in the Search for Hidden Graves in the Falstad Forest

In this lecture, a research project is presented that employs advanced digital methods to search for unknown graves in the Falstad Forest - a national memorial site linked to Gestapo executions during World War II. Using GIS technology, geophysical surveys, and historical sources, researchers aim to shed new light on the fate of the missing, without disturbing the protected area.

[Kristoffer Eliassen Grini](https://falstadsenteret.no/ansatte) is a researcher at the [Falstad Centre](https://falstadsenteret.no). He holds a PhD in contemporary archaeology from NTNU (2022) and works with both material and immaterial traces of war and conflict.
