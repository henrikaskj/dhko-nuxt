- **Thursday, March 13, 11:30-12:00 [IN NORWEGIAN]**

The speaker is [Siv Gøril Brandtzæg](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/siv.brandtzag), Associate Professor of Literary Studies at the [Department of Language and Literature](https://www.ntnu.edu/isl) at NTNU.

In the years 2018-2022, several projects were launched in Norway that aimed to shed light on the place of broadside poems in Norwegian cultural heritage. In one of these projects, the NTNU [Gunnerus Library's](https://www.ntnu.edu/ub/libraries/gunnerus) collection of broadside prints was digitized. The work to make the collection available was led by Siv Gøril Brandtzæg, who also created the first and currently only database of broadside poems in Norway.

In this lecture, Siv Gøril Brandtzæg will talk about the work of developing the database, which is built on the open web application Omeka. The construction and design of the database was a collaboration between Brandtzæg and the IT department at NTNU. The collaboration also included a web designer from a private company. Brandtzæg will talk about the collaboration with the various actors, and what challenges she, as a humanist without IT skills, faced on the way to the database.

The session will introduce the key features of [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/), demonstrating how it can address common data challenges such as inconsistent formatting, duplicate entries, and incomplete records. This lecture is intended for a broad audience, and showcases practical scenarios where OpenRefine can significantly reduce manual data preparation efforts.
